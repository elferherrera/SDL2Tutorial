![example image](https://github.com/elferherrera/SDL2Tutorial/blob/master/part_2/moving.jpg "Example Image")

In this part of the tutorial a box is moved using the mouse and
the arrow keys.

In order to update the position of the box the arrow and mouse
events are tracked. When the arrow keys are pressed the box is
moved by a STEP_SIZE. When the mouse is moved inside the window 
the box will follow the mouse and update its position.
