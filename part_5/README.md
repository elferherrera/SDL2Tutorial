In this part of the tutorial a matrix is used to simulate a tetris board
and all the movement of the pieces in the game. In this example the code is split in modules
in order to improve code organization and structure.

The module tetris contains all the logic required to move the pieces and how
they interact with the board. The module surfaces is used to draw all the available textures
in the game.
