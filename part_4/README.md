# Part 4: Using sprites

![example image](https://github.com/elferherrera/SDL2Tutorial/blob/master/part_4/sprites.jpg "Example Image")

In this part of the tutorial a bitmap sheet of characters is used to animate
a figure in the window. The character can be moved using the arrow keys and the type
of character can be changed using the space bar. Just to mess around with the game
logic the size of the character can be changed by using the keys V and B.
