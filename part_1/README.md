![alt text](https://github.com/elferherrera/SDL2Tutorial/blob/master/part_1/build.rs "Example Image")

In this part of the tutorial two boxes are drawn by creating a texture and
copying the result to the canvas using the copy and copy_ex methods.

The running application also prints all the events that could happen while the
window is open. Some of these events are the pressed keys and the mouse
movements.
